          <p>This is the UiKit assesment done by Joaquin Atienza, the picture is in format .jpg (available for download when click on the button above), let´s explain it more in detail
          <br>-This UIkit is ment to be a for a finantial app, focus on the teen market, it was done in photoshop, then exported and edited by the Photos aplication of Microsoft to add some filters,
           there were more opction like using Ilustrate but photoshop is a more complete program.
           <br><br>-The was almost no expirience with photshop I follow some tutorial from cydia, I especially recomend the one in
          <a style="color:black;" href="https://www.lynda.com/Photoshop-tutorials/UX-Design-Tools-Photoshop-CC/560063-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a1%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3auser+interface+kit+photoshop%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2" ><b>this text.</b></a>
           <br><br>-I decided to used red as a background theme after a fist atemp of a UIKIT that went terrible wrong (check image below), there was no style, no harmony and no nothing, so I checked some pages and decided to used red as some examples of
          <a style="color:black;" href="https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/how-to-choose-color-for-your-website/" ><b>this article.</b></a>
          Plus I always like the color and the contrast white and red make expres some energy, like Coca-cola, eveyone likes it but is focus on the young market, so the brand doesn´t lose it´s strength.
          <br>
           </p>
           <img src="archives/uikittry1.png"  download="uikittry1joaquin.jpg" alt="UIKIT joaquin" width="600" height="400">
           <p>
            <br>-Then the design was made with some intentions, the uikit is divided into 3 colums, the left colums where design as if it was a touch menu, when the MAIN MENU this will disapear, and arrow with open like the Close one will come out.
            <br><br>The column in the middle has the name of the brand, in this case APP TEEN on top with your salaty, probably the most important thing the user
           needs to know so it´s right at the top. Then below are what we thought were the most relevant things that the user should see, the four main bottoms, access web, settings, see your mail and contact. Then the acces to the aplication was done small on purpose, as if it was big the user will
           go direct to the login and we want him to see the offers of the right column.
           There is a calender in which important days (as ones witih discounts) will be mark, like tha last week of june that is all marked in blue.
           </p>
           <br><br>-Then the third column was design, originally there was only ment to show you the products, a video of them and if you like them or no (Picture below Uikit phase2). But that was not enough so I Added some more elements, the bottoms on the corner to activate the music and to stop the automatich search of articles.
           Below are the cheap deals found by the search, you can select the products and buy then (like) or not, you can also chose a number between 1-5 so we now if you like this type of articles or not.
           <img src="archives/uikittry2.jpg"  download="uikittry1joaquin.jpg" alt="UIKIT joaquin" width="600" height="400"> 
         	<br><br>-The phase priority was to correct the mistakes from the first phase but the colours where not mixing well, I Decided then to turn everything a little more red, still I left the four main element in different colour, for me they are really important, usually when they contact the App is because of something important and no time has to be wated on that.
         	<br><br>-There are a lot of elements display in this Uikit; bottoms for the choices , calendar with important days marked , links, checkboxes, textboxes for the number of units, video....The elements try to fit with the style of the design, leaving space between the elements, choosing different size when appropiate, like bigger more important of for some big groups (like menu that contains other elements). 
         	<br><br>This is my work, I hope you enjoy it
